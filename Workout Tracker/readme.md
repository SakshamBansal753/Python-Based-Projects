# Hello Young Guns! I am Saksham 💪

This project is a simple Python script that helps you **log your daily workouts** using the **Nutritionix API** to analyze exercises and the **Sheety API** to record them in a Google Sheet.

## 🚀 What It Does

1. Takes your exercise input in plain English (e.g., "ran 3 km and did 20 push-ups").
2. Sends it to Nutritionix to calculate duration and calories.
3. Logs the results in a Google Sheet with the current date and time.
