# ðŸ”¤ NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

Hello young guns,  
I am **Saksham Bansal** â€“ welcome to my fun little project that turns your name (or any word) into the **NATO phonetic alphabet**!

---

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

This Python script takes a word (like your name), breaks it into individual letters, and converts each letter into its corresponding NATO phonetic code using data from a CSV file.

Input:
Enter Your Name: Saksham

makefile
Copy
Edit

Output:
['Sierra', 'Alpha', 'Kilo', 'Sierra', 'Hotel', 'Alpha', 'Mike']
## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Reads the NATO phonetic alphabet from a CSV file using **pandas**
2. Creates a dictionary where each letter maps to its NATO code
3. Takes user input and converts it to uppercase
4. Loops through each letter and fetches its phonetic code
5. Prints the final list

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library

Install pandas with:
```bash
pip install pandas
```
Thank You Happy Coding
