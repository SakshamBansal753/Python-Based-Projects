# Weather Alert System

Hello Young Guns! ðŸ‘‹

I am Saksham, and this is my Weather Alert System project that fetches the weather forecast for a given location and sends an SMS notification via Twilio if it's going to rain. This is a simple yet effective way to stay informed and never get caught in the rain again! â˜”

## Features

- Fetches 4-hour weather forecast from OpenWeather API.
- Checks for rain conditions in the forecast.
- Sends an SMS alert if rain is expected, using Twilio.

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- A valid OpenWeather API Key (you can sign up for free [here](https://openweathermap.org/)).

- A Twilio phone number for sending SMS.
- A phone number to receive the SMS alert.
