******Hello I am Saksham Bansal Here I have created a vast range of projects from a beginner level to adbvanced level******<br>
## 👋 Hello, I'm Saksham Bansal!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in building real-world projects and continuously pushing the boundaries of what I can create with code.

Over time, I’ve worked on a **wide variety of Python projects**, ranging from beginner-level scripts to more complex and advanced applications. These projects not only helped strengthen my understanding of programming fundamentals but also exposed me to real-world problem-solving, optimization, and software design.

### 🐍 Why Python?

Python is one of the most versatile and beginner-friendly programming languages out there. Whether it's data analysis, automation, web development, or even AI — Python plays a significant role across all domains of technology. Its readability and massive ecosystem make it an excellent tool for both new learners and experienced developers.

### 📁 Repository Structure

To make things easier to explore, I’ve organized the projects across **two separate public branches**:

- **🔰 Member Branch**:  

  This branch is perfect if you are just starting out. It includes:

- Small, easy-to-understand scripts
- Foundational programs that build core logic
- Practical examples of loops, conditionals, file handling, and more

- **🚀 Main Branch**:  
  This branch showcases more complex, scalable, and feature-rich applications. These include real-world use cases, object-oriented design, file handling, web scraping, automation, and more.
  - Intermediate programs with object-oriented programming
- Projects with real-world applications and scalable logic
- Concepts like file I/O, exception handling, data structures, APIs
- Automation scripts and utility-based tools
- Mini frameworks and application prototypes
